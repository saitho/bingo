Play bingo!

This repository is based on [the bingo by ajwgeek](https://github.com/ajwgeek/OverwatchBingo).
While it is currently still focused on Overwatch and its cards are pretty much personal phrases and insiders,
the long-term goal is to create an application which can be used for multiple themes and audiences.
